 TASK INSTRUCTIONS:

 You have been provided an incomplete code for a Console App that can calculate the area of three Shapes (Triange, Rectangle, Circle).
 Complete the program by following the program flow below, you must modify the AreaCalculator.cs by adding code to the designated area. Please read the line comments carefully.
 You are also expected to create Derived classes (Triangle, Square, Circle) of the BaseShape object so that you can use it to implement the BaseShape object's GetArea() method.
 Add your derived classes to ShapeClasses folder.
 
 
 == program flow ==

1) prompt the user for the shape type.
   1 = Triangle
   2 = Rectangle
   3 = Circle
   *** if input is none of the above. 
       print error message and prompt again.

if shape is triangle / square
   2a) prompt the user for the height. 
   2b) prompt the user for the width.   
             
if shape is circle
   2) Prompt the user for the radius.

*** For step 2, input value(s) must be more than 0.
    If not, display error message and prompt again.
             
3) print result. (this is already provided)



Formulas:

Triangle: Height * Width / 2
Square: Height * Width
Circle: (Radius * Radius) * 3.14
